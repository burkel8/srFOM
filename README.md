# Sketched Recycled FOM (srFOM) 

A library that implements recycled FOM (rFOM), and sketched-recycled FOM (srFOM) proposed in [1] for sequences of matrix function applications.

## Tests
All test scripts used to generate the plots in [1] can be found in the tests "folder". These files are:

test_quad_v_closed: compares the closed-form formulation of recycled FOM against the quadrature-based implementation 
presented in [2].

test_inv_sqrt_fixed_m.m: runs the inverse square root example, and generates a plot of the error for each method  obtained after a fixed number of Arnoldi iterations.

test_inv_sqrt_fixed_reltol.m: runs the inverse square root example, and generates a plot of the Arnoldi cycle length required for each method to converge.

test_exp.m: runs the exponential example.

test_inv.m: runs the inverse example.
