# Sketched Recycled FOM (srFOM) 

A library which implements recycled FOM (rFOM), and sketeched-recycled FOM (srFOM) proposed in [1] for sequences of matrix function applications.

## Tests
All test scripts used to generate the plots in [1] can be found in the Tests folder. These files are:

test_quad_v_closed: compares the closed form formulation of recycled FOM against the quadrature based implementation 
presented in [2].
test_inv_sqrt1.m: runs the inverse square root example while computing A*U between problems.
test_inv_sqrt2.m: runs the inverse square root example while avoiding computation of A*U between problems.
test_exp.m: runs the exponential example
test_inv.m: runs the inverse example.
