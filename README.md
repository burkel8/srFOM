# Sketched Recycled FOM (srFOM) 

A library which implements recycled FOM (rFOM), and sketeched-recycled FOM (srFOM) for sequences of matrix function applications proposed in

## Tests
All test run scripts used to generate the plots in [1] can be found in the Tests folder. These files are:

test_quad_v_closed: compares the closed form formulation of recycled FOM against the quadrature based implementation 
presented in [2].

test_qcd_sign1.m: runs the QCD example
test_exp.m: runs the exponential example
test_inv.m: runs the inverse function example.
